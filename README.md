# 2048
A scalable, vanilla JS, native ES6 application of 2048

# Objective
Create a 2048 game with a minimalistic, dependency-free approach that is behavior-driven and scalable for cross-platform support.

# Requirements
* A web browser that supports JavaScript modules
* Node.js and NPM (for dev dependencies and running features)

# Special Features
* 2048 is traditionally played on a 4x4 grid but the dimensions can be change with the `rows` and `cols` options.
* User controlled events and display rendering are individually encapsulated components supplied to the game.
* A keyboard control and browser display driver have been implemented for the minimal viable product (MVP).
